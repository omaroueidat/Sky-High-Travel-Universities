# Sky-High-Travel-Universities
This is my first project when first learning basic HTML and CSS.
As a group of 5, we worked on a project of Sky High Travel which gives you information about 5 countries to visit with a discount of travel tickets and expenses. Each one worked on a page, for me I worked on the university page where you can search and apply for top universities of those 5 countries, with a discount of course.
This page is made with basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, so don't expect much :/
